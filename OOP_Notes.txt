Objects and Classes
-----------------------
* Member variables - object attributes or fields that belong to a data type or class.

* Local variables - variables within methods code blocks that are not member variables, they vanish when the method ends (goes out of scope or returns).


* Parameter variables - those that are declared in your method signature (between the parentheses!) which are also arguments?

-----------------in the Class file----------------------
public class MyClass {
    Modifiers:
    * private: Only the class in which it is declared can see and access the method. This is the most restrictive access level.
    * protected: Protected access gives subclasses a chance to use the method, while preventing a nonrelated class from trying to use it.
    * public: Every class everywhere has access to the method.

    //   member attributes   //

    //   CONSTRUCTOR   //
    * public MyClass(DataType nameOfVariable){
        this.attribute = nameOfVariable;
    * doesn't have a return type

    }

    //   METHODS   //
    public void (void can be used when datatype is not needed for method)
    * method names should be a verb
    
    * static modifier: One rule-of-thumb: ask yourself "does it make sense to call this method, even if an object has not been constructed yet?" 

    //   GETTERS AND SETTERS   //
* get methods - need to have a returnType and returns
* set methods - can be void type and do not need returns
}

---------in the Main/Test file-----------------
* compile this file - "javac TestFile.java" in the terminal

* parameters in instatiation
