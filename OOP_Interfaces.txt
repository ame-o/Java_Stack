INTERFACE METHODS

* default methods - allow creators to use default methods that do not need implementation
                    -declared wth "default"
* static methods - interface member methods implemented on the interface level 
                - not the class / therefore cannot be 
                - declared with "static"
* abstract methods - declared without implementation

----implementation----
* must use the keyword "implements" in our class definitions
* a class that implements an interface must implement all methods except default and static

* classes can implement multiple interfaces but can only inherit from one superclass

--------comparing interfaces with classes----------
* can contain any number of methods
* file name must match interface name
*package name must match to be able to use file with classes
* cannot instantiate an interface / therefore no constructors
* fields in an interface mustbe static and final /cannot change
* an interface can "extend" multiple interfaces
